	\section{Introduction}
	``Semantic role labeling, sometimes also called shallow semantic parsing, is a task in natural language processing consisting of the detection of the semantic arguments associated with the predicate or verb of a sentence and their classification into their specific roles." [wiki]
	These days, there emerged new approaches on dependency parser, we want to see how it will help the semantic role labeling task.
	find relations and find roles for words.
	
	
	
	\section{Related Works}
	I mainly will use one previous achievement, A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks \cite{manning-EtAl:2014:P14-5}.

	\section{Background}
	``The goal of the semantic role labeling task is to discover the predicateâ€“argument structure
	of each predicate in a given input sentence." In this work, we only focus on the verb predicate.
	
	\section{Method}
	We will try to implement a semantic role labeling program, mainly something based on the dependency parser proposed in Manning's paper \cite{manning-EtAl:2014:P14-5}. We maybe will implement some method in previous papers. Another option is for implement a new neural network for this task.
	
	\section{Experiment}
	For dependency parser, they report they have this accuracy,\\
	Development: 	(1700 sentences)	UAS	92.0	LAS	89.7\\
	Test:			(2416 sentences)	UAS	91.7	LAS	89.5
	
	We don't have their original data, but maybe we could try to test on the data used by the paper CoNLL-2005 Shared Task.
